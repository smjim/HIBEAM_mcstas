# HIBEAM_mcstas
Beam design and component simulation for HIBEAM nnbar experiment at ESS

Custom McStas component: "Venetian Blinds" differential neutron reflector is modeled after "Nested Reflector" concept in [X-Ray astronomy](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/educators/programs/xmm/mission/mirrors.html)
Desmos [Geometry visualization](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ehkfioczjt) of Venetian Blinds
 - neutrons reflected off mirrors focused towards center of detector
 - gap in center of blade array to allow undeflected neutrons to pass through
 - possible future update: implement continuous deflection (change angle of blades throughout run) to account for distance fallen by slow neutrons due to gravity

HIBEAM experiment meant to improve upon 1991 (published 1994) ILL nnbar oscillation experiment
